## Hi! This is Haorong, welcome to my item tracking system.

### This tracking system includes the functionality to create, read, update, and delete items. I develpoed an additional feature for download all the item data in a CSV file. 

### This project is build using the Django web framework with Python 3.9.7. If you do not have python3 in your computer, please check this link:
    
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

### In order to successfully start the tracking system, you will need to run the following lines in terminal to install dependencies:

    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install django
    pip install django-crispy-forms

### To start the server:

    cd inventory_tracking_app/
    python3 manage.py runserver

### The server will be run at:
    
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Reference: Some of the front-end designs are learned from this tutorial:
