# Hi! This is Haorong, welcome to my item tracking system.

## This tracking system includes the functionality to create, read, update, and delete items. 
## I develpoed an additional feature for download all the item data in a CSV file.

## This project is build using the Django web framework with Python 3.9.7
## If you do not have python3 in your computer, please check this link:
    
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

## In order to successfully start the tracking system, you will need to run the following 
## lines in terminal to install dependencies:

    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install django
    pip install django-crispy-forms

## To start the server:

    cd inventory_tracking_app/
    python3 manage.py runserver

## The server will be run at:
